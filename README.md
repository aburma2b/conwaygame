An implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Done as part of MIT6.189 "A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python" course. The course was done as a self-study course so I could get familiar with Python. The code template used for this project was provided as part of the course. The graphics library is based on Version 5 of the Zelle Graphics library which slight modifications done by Ankush Burman to remove a bug.
